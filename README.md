# RetrofitTutorial

Retrofit is a type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java. It makes communicating with a web service easy, by abstracting the REST API 
into a Java interface. It uses annotation processing to autogenerate the underlying low level networking code for us.
In this project we will learn how to add Retrofit to our Android Studio project and how to use it to make network requests in your app.
We will explore the different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE etc.), as well as other features, like Path and Query placeholders.
